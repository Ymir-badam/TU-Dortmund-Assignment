Specifically, it explores the effects of bread type (whole grain, Multigrain, Rye, White), topping (Ham with gherkins, peanut butter, Yeast spread), and the presence or absence of butter on the number of ants attracted to each sandwich. Understanding how ingredient combinations affect ant behavior can offer insights into food attractiveness and pest control strategies.Research QuestionsThe primary objective of this analysis was to identify which factors or interactions significantly affect ant attraction. The study aimed to determine whether specific combinations of ingredients lead to significantly higher or lower ant counts.Experimental DesignA controlled full-factorial experimental design was employed for this study.Factors:Bread Type: whole grain, Multigrain, Rye, White (4 levels)Topping: Ham and gherkins, Peanut butter, Yeast spread (3 levels)Butter Presence: Yes, No (2 levels)Observations: Each unique sandwich combination (4 bread types × 3 topping types × 2 butter conditions = 24 unique formulations) was replicated twice, resulting in 48 total observations.Procedure: Sandwiches were prepared and placed near an anthill for a predetermined, fixed duration. The number of ants on or immediately surrounding each sandwich was then meticulously counted and recorded.VariablesThe dataset for analysis comprised four variables:antCount: The response variable, representing the number of ants observed on a sandwich. This is a quantitative, discrete variable measured on a ratio scale.bread: A categorical explanatory variable with four levels: whole grain, Multigrain, Rye, and White.topping: A categorical explanatory variable with three levels: Ham and gherkins, Peanut butter, and Yeast spread.butter: A binary categorical explanatory variable with two levels: Yes (butter present) and No (no butter).Statistical AnalysisAll statistical analyses were performed with a predetermined significance level (α) of 0.05.Descriptive Statistics: Initial descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum antCount) were computed. The overall mean ant count was 43.50 ants, with a standard deviation of 15.15.Assumption Checks: Rigorous checks were performed on the model's residuals:Normality of Residuals: Assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test (p-value = 0.193), Normal Q-Q plot, and a histogram of residuals.Independence of Observations: Primarily ensured by the experimental design.Homogeneity of Variance: Evaluated using Levene's Test (Bread: p=0.666; Topping: p=0.535; Butter: p=0.970) and a residuals vs. fitted values plot.Three-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA): A three-way ANOVA was conducted to determine the statistical significance of main effects and interaction effects.Post-Hoc Analysis (Tukey HSD): Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) post-hoc tests were performed for factors with significant main effects and the significant three-way interaction.Key FindingsMain Effects:Bread Type: Not statistically significant (F(3,24)=0.142, p=0.934).Topping: Highly statistically significant (F(2,24)=19.573, p<0.001). Ham and gherkins significantly attracted more ants than both Peanut butter and Yeast spread.Butter: Highly statistically significant (F(1,24)=14.591, p<0.001). Sandwiches with butter generally attracted significantly more ants than those without butter.Interaction Effects:Two-Way Interactions: None were statistically significant.Three-Way Interaction: A statistically significant three-way interaction was observed (bread:topping:butter, F(6,24)=4.113, p<0.05). This indicates a complex, non-additive relationship where the effect of one factor on ant attraction is contingent on the specific combination of the other two.Highest Attraction: The combination of Multi Grain bread with Ham and gherkins and butter consistently emerged as a top performer (mean = 69.5 ants), representing a synergistic peak in ant attraction.Context-Dependent Butter Effect: The presence of butter does not universally increase ant attraction; its effect is highly conditional on the specific bread and topping. For example, for Rye bread with Peanut butter and Multi Grain bread with Yeast spread, ant count was higher without butter.Bread Type's Role: Even though bread type showed no significant main effect, its role in the three-way interaction was vital, with Multi Grain bread out-attracting others within the highly attractive "Ham and gherkins + butter" category.Repository Structure.
